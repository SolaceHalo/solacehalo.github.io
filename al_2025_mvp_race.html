      <h1>The 2025 AL MVP race</h1>
        <p>With the majority of the season through, it has become <em>clear</em> that only two men have a serious chance at MVP in the American League: Aaron Judge and Cal Raleigh.</p>
        <p>Judge is a right fielder for the New York Yankees while Raleigh is a catcher for the Seattle Mariners.</p>

       <h2>God of WAR</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders/major-league?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=8&season=2025&month=0&season1=2025&ind=0">According to FanGraphs,</a> Judge leads MLB in WAR (Wins Above Replacement, a general stat that encompasses all aspects of a player). He has 7.3 WAR. Raleigh is 2nd, with a close but slightly lower 7.0 WAR.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2025-batting-leaders.shtml">On Baseball Reference,</a> Judge leads MLB with 6.8 WAR, while Raleigh is 5th with 5.7 WAR.</p>
       <h2>Full Frontal Assault</h2>
	<p>Looking strictly at offensive numbers, Judge is the superior player. Much of the close WAR numbers come from Raleigh being a C, which on average is the best position defensively and worst position offensively. Judge plays RF, a stronger position hitting-wise and less important fielding-wise.</p>
        <ul><strong>Judge leads MLB in</strong></ul>
	  <li>batting average</li>
	  <li>on-base percentage</li>
	  <li>slugging</li>
	  <li>and more advanced offensive stats like wRC+ and wOBA</li>

       <h2>Outta the Park</h2>
	<p>Cal Raleigh leads MLB with <a href="https://www.mlb.com/stats/">46 home runs.</a> Raleigh would have to hit 16 homers in 38 games to tie Judge's 2022 record of most AL homers in a single season. He is currently on pace for 60 home runs.</p>
       <h2>Staying Healthy</h2>
	<p>On July 27th, Judge hit the IL with a right flexor strain. He returned to the Yankees on August 6th strictly as a DH. While a relatively short injury, health is extremely valuable in a baseball player. At the All-Star Break, Judge had 7.4 fWAR and 7.1 bWAR. Both have shrunk. Raleigh, by contrast, has been healthy all year. WAR is ultimately a counting stat. The more games, the more WAR one can accumulate.</p>
