      <h1>The 2025 AL MVP race</h1>
        <p>At the All-Star break, it has become <em>clear</em> that only two men have a serious chance at MVP in the American League: Aaron Judge and Cal Raleigh.</p>
        <p>Judge is a right fielder for the New York Yankees while Raleigh is a catcher for the Seattle Mariners.</p>

       <h2>God of WAR</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders/major-league?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=8&season=2025&month=0&season1=2025&ind=0">According to FanGraphs,</a> Judge leads MLB in WAR (Wins Above Replacement, a general stat that encompasses all aspects of a player). He has 7.4 WAR. Raleigh is 2nd, but has a noticeable drop-off with 6.2 WAR.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2025-batting-leaders.shtml">On Baseball Reference,</a> Judge leads MLB with 7.1 WAR, while Raleigh is 3rd with 4.8 WAR.</p>
	<ul><strong>Judge leads MLB in</strong></ul>
	  <li>batting average</li>
	  <li>on-base percentage</li>
	  <li>slugging</li>
	  <li>and more advanced offensive stats like wRC+ and wOBA</li>
       <h2>Better Team?</h2>
	<p>MVP is an individual award. In my opinion, making the postseason should not factor into a player's MVP chances at all. However, for a few voters, this is the case.</p>
	<p>Both the Yankees and Mariners are in wild card contention. The Yankees are only 2 games behind the Toronto Blue Jays, while the Mariners are 5 GB the Houston Astros. However, each team's <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/baseball-reference-faqs/">Pythagorean W-L</a> tell a different story. The Yankees are 53-43, but would expected to be 59-37. The Mariners are 51-45, same as their Pythagorean W-L record.</p>

       <h2>Outta the Park</h2>
	<p>Cal Raleigh leads MLB with <a href="https://www.mlb.com/stats/">38 home runs.</a> The Mariners have played 96 MLB games. Raleigh would have to hit 24 homers in 64 games to tie Judge's 2022 record of most AL homers in a single season. Raleigh is on pace for 64 home runs if he keeps up the same momentum as before the All-Star break.</p>
       <h2>Voter Fatigue</h2>
	<p>Aaron Judge won Rookie of the Year in 2017 and finished 2nd in the MVP race. He won MVP in 2022 and 2024. After a while, it gets dull seeing the same faces win MVP year after year.</p>
	<p>However, it should be mentioned that voter fatigue is less prominent in MLB than in other sports. Barry Bonds won MVP 7 times!</p>
